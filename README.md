QIANets is a **quantum-inspired model compression framework** that reduces the size and inference time of deep learning models **without sacrificing accuracy**.  
By integrating quantum-inspired pruning, tensor decomposition, and annealing-based matrix factorization, QIANets achieves highly efficient compression for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as **GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, and DenseNet**.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Train a base CNN model (e.g., ResNet-18) using the provided dataset:
python train.py --dataset <dataset> --model <model-type>
Compress the model using quantum-inspired techniques:
python compress.py --model <trained-model-path> --compression-rate <rate>
Evaluate the compressed model:
python evaluate.py --model <compressed-model-path> --dataset <dataset>
Example Workflow
Train a model:
python train.py --dataset cifar10 --model resnet18
Compress using a 75% rate:
python compress.py --model models/resnet18.h5 --compression-rate 0.75
Evaluate:
python evaluate.py --model models/resnet18_compressed.h5 --dataset cifar10
üß© Quantum-Inspired Techniques
Quantum-Inspired Pruning
We draw from quantum measurement theory to prune unimportant weights based on probabilistic outcomes, reducing model size while maintaining fidelity.
Tensor Decomposition
Inspired by quantum state decomposition, this technique factorizes large weight matrices into smaller, efficient components for compact representation.
Annealing-Based Matrix Factorization
Employs a quantum-inspired annealing process to optimize factorization, balancing accuracy and compression efficiency.
üìä Results
In extensive testing on CNN models such as GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, and DenseNet, QIANets achieved:
50‚Äì70% reduction in inference times
Compression rates up to ~80% without significant accuracy loss
Faster deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile/edge)
Strong potential for real-time and edge AI applications
