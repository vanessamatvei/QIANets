QIANets is a **quantum-inspired model compression framework** that reduces the size and inference time of deep learning models **without sacrificing accuracy**.  
By integrating quantum-inspired pruning, tensor decomposition, and annealing-based matrix factorization, QIANets achieves highly efficient compression for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as **GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, and DenseNet**.

## ðŸ’» Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vanessamatvei/QIANets
cd QIANets   

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/vanessamatvei/QIANets
cd QIANets   

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up your environment for quantum-inspired computations:
[Optional] Install quantum computing libraries such as Qiskit for deeper exploration of the quantum principles.


### Usage
1. Train a base CNN model (e.g., ResNet-18) using the provided dataset:
python train.py --dataset <dataset> --model <model-type>

2. Compress the model using quantum-inspired techniques:
python compress.py --model <trained-model-path> --compression-rate <rate>

3. Evaluate the compressed model:
python evaluate.py --model <compressed-model-path> --dataset <dataset>

### Example Workflow
1. Train a model:
python train.py --dataset cifar10 --model resnet18

2. Compress using a 75% rate:
python compress.py --model models/resnet18.h5 --compression-rate 0.75

3. Evaluate:
python evaluate.py --model models/resnet18_compressed.h5 --dataset cifar10

### Quantum-Inspired Techniques
Quantum-Inspired Pruning: We draw from quantum measurement theory to prune unimportant weights based on probabilistic outcomes, reducing model size while maintaining fidelity.
Tensor Decomposition: Inspired by the decomposition of quantum states, this technique factorizes large weight matrices into smaller, efficient components.
Annealing-Based Matrix Factorization: Employs a quantum-inspired annealing process to optimize the factorization, balancing accuracy and compression efficiency.



### Results 
In extensive testing on CNN models such as GoogLeNet and DenseNet, QIANets achieved:
50-70% reduction in inference times
Compression rates of up to 80% without significant loss in accuracy
Faster deployment of models on resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile phones)
The approach shows significant promise for edge AI applications and large-scale deployment in real-time systems.
